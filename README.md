# Work day scheduler

Welcome to my work day scheduler.

This app pulls in the current date at the top using Luxon. The hours from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. are displayed in a chart. The user can type in something at any hour and hit the save button. The tasks (or inputs) are saved in localStorage so they persist even if you refresh the page.

Here is the live URL: https://amiracat.github.io/work-day-scheduler/

Here's how the page looks:
